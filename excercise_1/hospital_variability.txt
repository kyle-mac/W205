Which procedures have the greatest variability between hospitals?


Given that hospital procedural data was outlined within the "Timely and Effective Care - Hospital.csv" I chose to use this dataset for variability analysis.  The hive variance function combined with a group by allows for appropriate calculations of variance for each measure within this csv.  

The below table shows the top ten procedures with the highest variability:
