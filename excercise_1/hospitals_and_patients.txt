4.) Are average scores for hospital quality or procedural quality correlated with patient survey responses?

It order to properly assess this question it was necessary to join data between the Timely and Effective Care - Hospital.csv" and "hvbp_hcahps_05_28_2015.csv" dataset.

Specifically, the survey data was given at a hospital level rather than procedural, i.e. a patient scored the hospital in the survey and not specifically the procedure itself.  Given this notion there was no way to tie back to the survey procedure so I went ahead and tied the survey data back to the hospital rankings I had created through problem 1 to the survey base score as this score represents an aggregated score from the various HCAHPS survey questions [1].

Based on my calculations the overall scoring of correlations between the two was low as seen below and not indicitive of a strong correlation between the two based on the procedures used within my analysis:
