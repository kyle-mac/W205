# W205 Assignment 1

General Notes:

1.) After starting hadoop on my AWS instance and changing to user w205 I cloned downed this repo, hence the path will look like home/user/w205/W205.  From there cd into excercise_1/loading_and_modelling and run load_data_lake.sh to put the csv files and then run the hive_base_ddl.sql

2.) The ERD can be found within the loading and modelling directory

3.) For my transforming process I seperated my sql into two files as I wanted to create tables for analysis and sub-tables for easy joins and calculations used in 1-4.  For this reason, transforming_part_1.sql needs to be run prior to transforming_part_2.sql
